Since it takes really long time to run the codes, I save the plots in the folder **bld**, where you can see all the results for 4 models. In terms of 3D plots, I also provide a website link where you can have a detailed look at it.

I use R to write the codes, and separate it into 2 R.Files. One is for functions used, one is the codes for getting the results. They are in the folder **src/analysis**.

For explaining part, I write a pdf file to show the content. You can also see the codes and explaining part in Jupyter (ipynb File). They are in the folder **src/paper**.
